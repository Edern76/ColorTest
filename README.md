# ColorTest
Shows the result of various RGB combinations.
Made with Python 3.5 using the TDL library. Setup.py requires cx_Freeze. (setupmsi.py doesn't seem to work though)
Use the right and left arrows in order to select a colour to change and to change it's value. Pressing F1 brings up the help menu.
